**Ben Zhao** is the Neubauer Professor of Computer Science at University of Chicago. Prior to joining UChicago, he was a Professor of Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara. His research covers a range of topics from large-distributed networks and systems, HCI, security and privacy, and wireless / mobile systems, mostly from a data-driven perspective. His current projects are focused on three areas: data-driven models of user behavior/interactions, security of online and mobile communities, and wireless systems and protocols. His work targets a range of top conferences, including WWW/IMC, Mobicom/SIGCOMM/NSDI, UsenixSecurity/NDSS/S&P/CCS, CHI/CSCW. Here's a wordle of his paper abstracts from 2014-early 2017.

Together with Prof. Heather Zheng, Ben Zhao co-directs the SAND Lab (Systems, Algorithms, Networking and Data) at University of Chicago. He received his PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 2004, where he was advised by John Kubiatowicz and Anthony Joseph, and created the Tapestry distributed hash table (dissertation). He received his MS from Berkeley in 2000, and his BS in computer science from Yale in 1997. He is an ACM Distinguished Scientist, a recipient of the National Science Foundation's CAREER award (2005), MIT Tech Review's TR-35 Award (Young Innovators Under 35) (2006), IEEE Internet Technical Committee's Early Career Award (2014), and one of ComputerWorld's Top 40 Technology Innovators under 40. His papers have somewhere around 23,000 citations and an H-index of 57.
